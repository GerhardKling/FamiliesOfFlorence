# Families of Florence
I enjoyed some recreational programming during lockdown. This is a series of YouTube videos on building a trading game in Python.

## Python Game Dev: Intro
In my experience, learning by doing is the best way to master Python or any other programming language. So, you need to work on projects early in your learning journey. This video introduces a playlist that will guide you through a Python-based game. I called this game “Families of Florence”. I guess I watched too many episodes of Medici on Netflix. The game is about building an empire and ensuring your family survives. Use these tutorials as a guide and build anything you enjoy. Just have fun with it!

## Python Game Dev: Make a Plan
We explore the initial game and think about a strategy. Before you start coding, you must make a plan. What should you do first? The backend development or the graphical user interface (GUI). We look at the game's features, including starting a new game, families, politics, and empire-building. Next, we will begin working with Tkinter. The fun starts!

## Python Game Dev: Tkinter Intro
This session introduces Tkinter. Starting with the documentation, we walk through a minimal working example (MWE). We tackle the first error and build a very basic GUI. We learn about frames, buttons, and labels. We explore commands triggered by buttons. Join me!
